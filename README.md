# Dominos
The points of the game is to empty all the pieces in your hand , each piece has two
numbers and to place a piece on the board the numbers must match.

## Running the game

There will be a ready application included in the files to try and run the game,
host your own game and tell your friend to click the join button and enter the
hoster’s ip address and enjoy!.

## How to play
Each player has 7 pieces, you can get extra pieces if needed from the draw pile on the bottom right corner.
To play a piece you have to click on it , a screen will pop up asking you where you want to play it if you decide to put it on the left or on the right the piece will be rotated -90 degrees and will be played if you decide to flip the piece it will be rotated the opposite way, if your move is illegal you are asked to play again.

## Credits
this project would not have been possible without the kindness of the game
development community for putting free assets online for anyone to use. To honor
that kindness there is a button on the Main menu that displays the assets and their
creators for anyone interested in using them.
